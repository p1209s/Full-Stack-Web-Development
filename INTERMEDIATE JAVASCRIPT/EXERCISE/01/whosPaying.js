// Who's Buying Lunch? Code Challenge
// You are going to write a function which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

// Important: The output should e returned from the function and you do not need alert, prompt or console.log. The output should match the example output exactly, including capitalisation and punctuation.

// Example Input

// ["Angela", "Ben", "Jenny", "Michael", "Chloe"]
// Example Output

// Michael is going to buy lunch today!

// Hint

// 1. You might need to think about Array.length.

// 2. Remember that Arrays start at position 0!

function whosPaying(names) {
  /******Don't change the code above*******/

  //Write your code here.

  var numOfPeople = names.length;
  var posPeople = Math.floor(Math.random() * numOfPeople);
  var ranPerson = names[posPeople];
  return ranPerson + " is going to buy lunch today!";

  /******Don't change the code below*******/
}
